# Digital-Dice-Arduino
The Digital Dice is an interactive electronic system built around the Arduino Uno development board. Designed to replace traditional dice with a sound-activated digital version, the project utilizes a sound sensor module with a microphone to detect claps or loud noises. Once a sound is detected, the Arduino initiates a random number generation algorithm to simulate a dice roll. The results are displayed on two digits of a 4-digit, 7-segment LED display using a technique called multiplexing, which switches the digits on and off at a high frequency to make them appear lit simultaneously. For a complete sensory experience, a buzzer provides auditory feedback by emitting short ticking sounds during the animation and a long beep to confirm the final result. The entire circuit is assembled on a breadboard and powered via USB, demonstrating core concepts such as digital signal processing and real-time timing management.
